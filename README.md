# Hash Cracker Speed Comparer

This is a repository for testing each programming language speed when performing hash cracking, currently it only supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512

The idea is to create the same scrpit in many different scripting languages in order to perform a test speed between each languages. Currently you can see that bash is the slowest of them all and surprisingly php is the fastest one. Not sure yet if this has to be for the language or the desing of the script, but we will keep working on it
